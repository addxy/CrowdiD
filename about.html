      <h3>Welcome!</h3>
      <p>Note to users: The application is still in testing. You may have to enable popups for this website to 
      be able to register and login.</p>
      
      <p>We are pleased to have you join us for this new pilot project from Statistics Canada. It must be first be emphasized 
      that this is a pilot. This is like an experiment, one in which you can participate! As a pilot, it is an opportunity 
      to learn how working together can improve national statistics and services by and for the people who know best: you!</p>
      
      <p>The project is making use of <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?locale=en-CA#map=13/45.4243/-75.7205">
      OpenStreetMap (OSM)</a>">OpenStreetMap</a> as a platform for inviting contributors to crowdsource information 
      on buildings. The pilot project will focus on the Ottawa-Gatineau 
      region for now. There are currently no accurate national-level statistics on buildings— and their attributes—that 
      can be used to compare specific local areas. The information you submit will help to fill existing data gaps and 
      provide new analytical opportunities that are important to data users.</p>

	 <p>This project will also teach us about the possibilities and limitations of crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing data collection 
	 may become a way for Statistics Canada and other organizations around the world to collect much-needed information by reaching 
	  out to citizens.</p>
	  
	  <h3>Getting started</h3>
	  <p>The first thing you can do if you are new to OpenStreetMap is to go to the: 
	  <a href="http://learnosm.org/en/">Beginner's guide</a> You will need to register to OpenStreetMap to be able
	  to contribute. The guide explains how. When you start the application, you have to log in after you have registered.</p>
	  
	  <p>The rest is simple: zoom in and explore the map. Click on buildings you know and enter information about them 
	  in the form on the left. You can also add a new point to add businesses, shops and services like a post office. Look carefully 
	  to make sure that the information is not already there.</p>

	  
	  <h3>Collaborations</h3>
	  This project would not be possible without key collaborations. <a href="http://www.opennorth.ca/">Open North</a> is 
	  collaborating with Statistics Canada for the implementation of this pilot project. Open North is a nonprofit organization 
	  with a proven track record nationally and internationally who offers open data solutions and civic technology tools that 
	  scale both the national and local levels to foster better and more open democracies.</p> 
	  
	  The <a href="http://ottawa.ca/en">City of Ottawa</a> and the OSM Canada community are also vital collaborators in this project.
