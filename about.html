	 <h3>Important note</h3>
	
      <p>The application is in its beta version. You may have to enable popups for 
      this website to be able to register and login.</p>  
       
	  <h3>Welcome!</h3>  
      <p>We are pleased to have you join us for this new pilot project from Statistics Canada. As a pilot, it is an 
      opportunity to learn how working together could improve national statistics. With this project, we are excited 
      to join the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/?locale=en-CA#map=13/45.4243/-75.7205">OpenStreetMap (OSM)</a> community.</p>

      <p>The pilot is using OSM as an open data platform for inviting contributors to crowdsource information on buildings. The pilot 
      project will focus on the Ottawa-Gatineau region for now. There are currently no accurate national-level statistics on 
      buildings— and their attributes—that can be used to compare specific local areas. The information you submit will help to 
      fill existing data 
      gaps and provide new analytical opportunities that are important to data users.

	 <p>This project will also teach us about the possibilities and limitations of crowdsourcing. Crowdsourcing data collection 
	 may become a way for Statistics Canada and other organizations around the world to collect much-needed information by reaching 
	 out to citizens.</p>
 
	 <h3>Getting started</h3>
	 <p>The first thing you can do if you are new to OpenStreetMap is to go to the: 
	 <a href="http://learnosm.org/en/">Beginner's guide</a>. You will need to register to OpenStreetMap to be able 
	 to contribute. The guide explains how. When you start the application, you have to log in after you have registered.</p>
	  
	 <p>The rest is simple: zoom in and explore the map. You can switch from a topographic map to a satellite imagery base. 
	 Click on buildings you know and enter information about them in the form on the left. You can also add new points to add 
	 businesses, shops and services like a post office. Look carefully to make sure that the information is not already there.</p>
	  
	 <h3>Collaborations</h3>

	 <p>This project would not be possible without key collaborations. <a href="http://www.opennorth.ca/">Open North</a> is 
	 collaborating with Statistics Canada for the implementation of this pilot project. Open North is a non-profit organization 
	 with a proven track record nationally and internationally specialized in open data solutions and civic technology tools that 
	 scale both the national and local levels to foster better and more open democracies.</p> 
	  
	 <p>The <a href="http://ottawa.ca/en">City of Ottawa</a> and the <a href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/wiki/WikiProject_Canada">
	 OSM Canada</a> community are also key collaborators in this project.</p>
